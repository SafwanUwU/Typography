      <p>
        <abbr title="Theory of Relativity">Theory of Relativity</abbr> was
        formulated by Albert Einstein in <strong>1905</strong> (Special
        Relativity) and <strong>1915</strong> (General Relativity).

      <pre>
Einstein‚Äôs <strong>Theory of Relativity</strong> revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. 
It states that time slows down at high speeds, and massive objects can bend light. 
The famous equation <strong>E=mc¬≤</strong> shows that mass and energy are interchangeable. 
One of its fascinating effects is <strong>time dilation</strong>, where astronauts traveling near the speed of light would 
age slower than people on Earth. It also explains why GPS satellites must adjust their clocks 
to account for differences in time caused by gravity. 
From black holes to the expanding universe, relativity continues to shape modern physics! üöÄ‚ú®
